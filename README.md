# 🏃‍♀️ Sprint & Solve – Bolt App

**Fitness-themed DSA coding challenges — AI-generated with a One-Shot prompt using [Bolt.new](https://bolt.new)**

---

## 📌 Overview

**Sprint & Solve** reimagines classic DSA problems as fun, fitness-themed coding challenges.  
From hydration stations to lap-time tracking, each problem disguises real algorithmic patterns — like sliding window or longest increasing subsequence — in a running scenario.

This app was created using a single AI prompt via Bolt.new, deployed on Netlify with minimal manual changes.

## 🧠 Inspiration

This idea came from blending two things shaping daily life:  
Job prep with DSA… and running to stay sane.  

Turns out, every stat in running — pace, streaks, hydration stops — felt like a DSA pattern waiting to be solved.
