🏃‍♀️ Sprint & Solve

Fitness-themed DSA coding challenges — AI-generated with a One-Shot prompt using Bolt.new

📌 Overview

Sprint & Solve is a web app that presents classic Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) challenges reimagined as running-themed scenarios.

It was created using a single prompt via Bolt.new — a tool that generates full-stack apps from natural language descriptions. The project was deployed on Netlify with minimal manual changes.

🧠 Inspiration

The idea was inspired by blending two things shaping daily life:

Practicing for DSA interviews
Staying sane with a regular running habit
Each challenge mimics the structure of a real-world problem-solving pattern (e.g., sliding window, LIS, binary search) but framed as a fun athletic challenge.
