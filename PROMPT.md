# One-Shot Bolt Prompt: Sprint & Solve – Fitness-Themed Coding Challenges 🏃‍♂️⚡

## App Title:
Sprint & Solve: Fitness-Themed Coding Challenges

## App Purpose:
Build a single-page, mobile-responsive web app that helps users practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving word-problem-style coding challenges inspired by running and fitness scenarios.

## Functional Requirements:
### Challenge Display:
- Display one random challenge at a time from a hardcoded list of at least 20 running-themed DSA challenges.
- Challenges should be written in natural language like small running-related stories.
- Avoid technical DSA words like "array", "list", "binary search", "sliding window", etc.

### Navigation Buttons:
- "Next Challenge" + "Previous Challenge" buttons.
- Simple state memory for navigation.

### Show Hint Button:
- Reveals the DSA concept (e.g., “Dynamic Programming”).
- Fun emoji like 💡 on the button.

### Progress Tracking:
- Text like: "You’ve seen X out of 20 challenges"
- Progress bar or % indicator.

### Motivational Quote Logic:
- Random motivational quote per challenge.
- Does not auto-refresh; only updates with a new challenge.

### Interactive Elements (UI only):
- Notes textarea for rough ideas (no backend).
- "Favorite (⭐)" toggle (UI-only).
- "Share this Challenge" placeholder button.

### Optional UI Features:
- Light/Dark mode toggle
- Small animations or card-flip effect.

## Design Requirements:
- Use Tailwind CSS
- Card-based layout, clean typography
- Energetic theme: orange, teal, blue
- Fun emojis/icons (🏃‍♂️, 🏁, ⭐, 💡)

## Bolt Badge:
- Required: Bolt.new badge at bottom-right
- Link to [https://bolt.new/](https://bolt.new/)
- Use badge from GitHub repo: https://github.com/kickiniteasy/bolt-hackathon-badge

## Deployment Notes:
- For One-Shot competition
- No backend/database/login
- Hardcoded content and logic
- Bolt can auto-install packages as needed (Tailwind, Lucide, etc.)
